He blew the horn and said: “We have no share in David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesʹse. Everyone to his gods, O Israel!”"},{"p":"2","v":2},{"p":"At that all the men of Israel quit following David to follow Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri; but the men of Judah stuck to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem."}],[{"p":"3","v":3},{"p":"When David came to his house at Jerusalem, the king took the ten concubines he had left behind to take care of the house, and he put them in a house under guard. He supplied food to them, but he did not have any relations with them. They remained in confinement until the day of their death, living as if they were widows, even though they had a living husband."}],[{"p":"4","v":4},{"p":"The king now said to A·maʹsa: “Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and you also should be here.”"},{"p":"5","v":5},{"p":"So A·maʹsa went to call Judah together, but he came later than the set time that had been appointed for him."},{"p":"6","v":6},{"p":"Then David said to A·bishʹai: “Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri may do us more harm than Abʹsa·lom did. Take the servants of your lord and chase after him, so that he may not find fortified cities and escape from us.”"},{"p":"7","v":7},{"p":"So the men of Joʹab, the Cherʹe·thites, the Pelʹe·thites, and all the mighty men went out after him; they left Jerusalem to chase after Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri."},{"p":"8","v":8},{"p":"When they were near the great stone in Gibʹe·on, A·maʹsa came to meet them.

Please tell Joʹab, ‘Come here, and let me speak to you.’”"},{"p":"17","v":17},{"p":"So he went near to her, and the woman said: “Are you Joʹab?” He replied: “I am.” At this she said to him: “Listen to the words of your servant.” He said: “I am listening.”"},{"p":"18","v":18},{"p":"She continued: “They would always say in the past, ‘Let them inquire in Abel, and that was the end of the matter.’"},{"p":"19","v":19},{"p":"I represent the peaceable and faithful ones of Israel.

Rather, a man named Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri from the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im has rebelled against King David. If you hand over this one man, I will withdraw from the city.” Then the woman said to Joʹab: “Look! His head will be thrown over the wall to you!”"}],[{"p":"22","v":22},{"p":"At once the wise woman went in to all the people, and they cut off the head of Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri and threw it to Joʹab.
