Behave like a woman who has been mourning over someone dead for a long time."},{"p":"3","v":3},{"p":"Then go in and speak to the king like this.” With that Joʹab put the words in her mouth."}],[{"p":"4","v":4},{"p":"The Te·koʹite woman went in to the king and fell with her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said: “Help me, O king!”"},{"p":"5","v":5},{"p":"The king replied to her: “What is the matter?” To this she said: “Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead."},{"p":"6","v":6},{"p":"And I, your servant, had two sons, and the two of them fought with each other in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other down and killed him."},{"p":"7","v":7},{"p":"Now the whole family has risen up against me, your servant, and they are saying, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, even if it means wiping out the heir!’ They would extinguish the last glowing coal that I have left and leave to my husband neither a name nor a survivor on the surface of the earth.”"}],[{"p":"8","v":8},{"p":"Then the king said to the woman: “Go to your home, and I will issue an order regarding you.”"},{"p":"9","v":9},{"p":"At this the Te·koʹite woman said to the king: “O my lord the king, let the guilt be on me and on my father’s house, while the king and his throne are innocent.”"},{"p":"10","v":10},{"p":"The king then said: “If anyone speaks further to you, bring him to me, and he will never trouble you again.”"},{"p":"11","v":11},{"p":"But she said: “Please, let the king remember Jehovah your God, so that the avenger of blood does not bring ruin and annihilate my son.” To this he said: “As surely as Jehovah is living, not one of your son’s hairs will fall to the ground.”"},{"p":"12","v":12},{"p":"The woman now said: “Let your servant, please, speak a word to my lord the king.” So he said: “Speak!”"}],[{"p":"13","v":13},{"p":"The woman said: “Why, then, have you thought to do something like this against the people of God? When the king speaks this way, he makes himself guilty, for the king does not bring back his own banished son."},{"p":"14","v":14},{"p":"We will surely die and be like waters that are poured out on the ground, which cannot be recovered. But God would not take away a life, and he considers reasons why the banished one should not always be banished from him."},{"p":"15","v":15},{"p":"I have come in to say this to my lord the king because the people made me afraid. So your servant said, ‘Let me speak, please, to the king.

I sent this message to you, ‘Come and let me send you to the king to ask: “Why have I come from Geshʹur? It would have been better for me to stay there.
