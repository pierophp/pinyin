They stayed quiet the whole night, saying to themselves: “When daylight comes, we will kill him.”"}],[{"p":"3","v":3},{"p":"However, Samson kept lying there until midnight. Then he got up at midnight and grabbed the doors of the city gate and the two side posts and pulled them out along with the bar. He put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that faces Hebʹron."}],[{"p":"4","v":4},{"p":"After that he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Soʹrek whose name was De·liʹlah."},{"p":"5","v":5},{"p":"So the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines approached her and said: “Trick him and find out what gives him such great strength and how we can overpower him and tie him and subdue him. For this we will each give you 1,100 silver pieces.”"}],[{"p":"6","v":6},{"p":"De·liʹlah later said to Samson: “Please tell me where your great power comes from and what can be used to tie you and subdue you.”"},{"p":"7","v":7},{"p":"Samson said to her: “If they tie me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried out, I will grow as weak as an ordinary man.”"},{"p":"8","v":8},{"p":"So the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried out, and she tied him with them."},{"p":"9","v":9},{"p":"Now they set an ambush in the inner room, and she called out to him: “The Phi·lisʹtines are upon you, Samson!” At that he tore apart the bowstrings, just as easily as a thread of flax comes apart when it touches fire. The secret of his power did not become known."}],[{"p":"10","v":10},{"p":"Then De·liʹlah said to Samson: “Look! You have fooled me and told me lies. Now tell me, please, what can be used to tie you.”"},{"p":"11","v":11},{"p":"So he said to her: “If they tie me up with new ropes that have not been used for work, I will grow as weak as an ordinary man.”"},{"p":"12","v":12},{"p":"So De·liʹlah took new ropes and tied him with them and called out: “The Phi·lisʹtines are upon you, Samson!” (All the while the ambush was set in the inner room.)
