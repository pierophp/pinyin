The Hebrews are coming out from the holes where they have been hiding.”"},{"p":"12","v":12},{"p":"So the men of the outpost said to Jonʹa·than and his armor-bearer: “Come up to us, and we will teach you a lesson!” At once Jonʹa·than said to his armor-bearer: “Follow me, for Jehovah will give them into the hand of Israel.”"},{"p":"13","v":13},{"p":"And Jonʹa·than climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer was behind him; and the Phi·lisʹtines began to fall before Jonʹa·than, and his armor-bearer was putting them to death behind him."},{"p":"14","v":14},{"p":"In the first attack that Jonʹa·than and his armor-bearer made, they struck down about 20 men within about half the plowing line in an acre of field."}],[{"p":"15","v":15},{"p":"Then terror spread in the field camp and among all the people of the outpost, and even the raiding parties were terrified.
