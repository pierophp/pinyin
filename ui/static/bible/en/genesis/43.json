Do you have another brother?’ and we told him these facts. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”"}],[{"p":"8","v":8},{"p":"Judah then urged Israel his father: “Send the boy with me, and let us go on our way so that we may live and not die—we and you and our children."},{"p":"9","v":9},{"p":"I will be a guarantee for his safety.
