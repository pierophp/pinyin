Their breasts were squeezed there, and their virgin bosoms were fondled."},{"p":"4","v":4},{"p":"Their names were O·hoʹlah, the older one, and her sister O·holʹi·bah. They became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, O·hoʹlah is Sa·marʹi·a, and O·holʹi·bah is Jerusalem."}],[{"p":"5","v":5},{"p":"“O·hoʹlah began to prostitute herself while she belonged to me. She lusted after her passionate lovers, her neighbors the As·syrʹi·ans."},{"p":"6","v":6},{"p":"They were governors clothed in blue and deputy rulers—all desirable young men mounted on their horses."},{"p":"7","v":7},{"p":"She continued to prostitute herself with all the choicest sons of As·syrʹi·a, and she defiled herself with the disgusting idols of those she lusted after."},{"p":"8","v":8},{"p":"She did not abandon the prostitution she practiced in Egypt, for in her youth they had lain down with her, and they fondled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her."},{"p":"9","v":9},{"p":"So I gave her into the hand of her passionate lovers, the sons of As·syrʹi·a, after whom she had lusted."},{"p":"10","v":10},{"p":"They exposed her nakedness and seized her sons and daughters, and they killed her with a sword.
